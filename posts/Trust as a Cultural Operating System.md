# Trust as a Cultural Operating System

Trust isn’t just a virtue—it’s the underlying system that determines how well an organization runs. Like an OS, it affects speed, cost, and emotional bandwidth. A high-trust culture is productive by default; a low-trust one bogs down in friction, bureaucracy, and rework. Culture becomes the echo of how trust is built, taxed, or compounded through everyday behavior.
