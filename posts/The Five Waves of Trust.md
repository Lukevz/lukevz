# The Five Waves of Trust

Trust flows outward in waves—from self-trust to societal trust. Each layer depends on the one before:
* **Self**: Can I trust myself?
* **Relationship**: Do others feel safe with me?
* **Organizational**: Are we aligned internally?
* **Market**: What do outsiders see?
* **Societal**: Are we contributing to the greater good? This cascading model helps pinpoint where trust breaks or flourishes.
