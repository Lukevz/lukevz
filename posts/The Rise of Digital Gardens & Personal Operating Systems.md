# The Rise of Digital Gardens & Personal Operating Systems
#writing #status/draft

For a while, the way that we expressed ourselves online was mostly uninhibited. We were free to post whenever without much thought about whether it would be seen by the right people or how well it would perform.

Gradually, there has been a shift from self-expression to self-promotion. While there are practical reasons why, this process has largely been detrimental for creatives who may struggle to stay fresh and inspired; who prefer to publish one rough draft after another in order to analyze their creative process from start to finish.

But more than anything, there seems to be an inverse relationship with the amount of media and content on the internet, and the amount of personal space. Enter digital gardening.

This is a newer term that has been – [documented in great detail by Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) – that emphasizes the importance of publishing your thoughts and works in progress. The goal is to lower the threshold for what’s good enough to share online, not to lower the standard of quality, but to create a digital canvas to connect your findings and thoughts.

Dedicating a space soley for notes to evolve over time allows your brain time to map deeper insights to various checkpoints and indicators. There’s many methods to go about this, such as atomic notetaking or simply sharing each note as you are done with it.

Lately I’ve noticed a trend not just to produce a space you can self-host your thoughts and ideas, but to go a step further and build a true home, or “OS,” for these digital artifacts. I first heard of this concept when a coworker shared Ryo Lu’s (Head of design at Cursor, formerly at Notion) pet project, ryOS.

I was completely floored by this website because it was so immersive, packed with tons of easter eggs. As a product designer, the thing that surprised me was how fun it felt to explore, because there was no rules about how to move around. You could play games, chat, even browse through time on his website sim.

I’ve been thinking a lot about this the last few weeks as I’ve started to see more sites like it appear. I’m sure Ryo’s site is not the first, but there has certainly been an uptick lately and I thought it was worth exploring just why this works so well.

## 3 reasons digital gardens and personal OS’s work
### They’re personal
The thing that stands out most about these sites is that they are all unique. With the amount of bad AI-generated digital art these days, creatives using AI smartly sometimes get lost in the noise. 

The moment you land on one of these sites it feels like a breath of fresh air. They might not always stand out in the way *you* would expect – and you might even find them boring – but that’s the point. These sites aren’t for others, they’re for the artist. 

Surrounded by a sea of platforms and “influencers” who constantly push an agenda of hustling and producing, digital gardens and personal operating systems provide a calm place for thinkers to write and make something just for themselves.

Every site in this list is pretty different from each other. Sure, there are definitely patterns and common themes, but every one has built a system that aligns with how they think. And the more creative among them have found a way to turn it into a work of art.

### They’re real
There’s definitely nothing wrong with using AI to help out good content great, but there is still a certain feeling you get when consuming content that just doesn’t feel human.

Maggie Appleton illustrates this with a lovely, simple graph of how content publishing has evolved.

> Over the last decade, we’ve moved away from casual live journal entries and formalised our writing into articles and essays. These are carefully crafted, edited, revised, and published with a timestamp. When it’s done, it’s done. We act like tiny magazines, sending our writing off to the printer.
> 
> This is odd considering editability is one of the main selling points of the web. Gardens lean into this – there is no “final version” on a garden. What you publish is always open to revision and expansion.

There is a certain creative license that is unlocked when you don’t feel pressured to commit to a final version of your thoughts. In reality, we are constantly gathering more data, maturing, and generally evolving our thinking. If you suddenly have more thoughts to add or something to change, you just update it! If a principle or theme has stuck with you over time, it shows that it really is an evergreen product.

### They’re private
There’s something pretty intimate about getting to see what inspires others and get to read their raw, non-filtered opinions. Sure, it’s not for everyone, but it’s a certain organic exchange that you don’t seem to find much on big platforms.

Almost every digital garden I have found has been fully self-produced and self-hosted by the author. As the CEO of Obsidian wrote in his [*File over app* article](https://stephango.com/file-over-app)

> if you want to create digital artifacts that last, they must be files you can control, in formats that are easy to retrieve and read. Use tools that give you this freedom.

There are no constraints when you own your domain *and* everything you post can travel with you through time. This adds an extra layer of encouragement to post-at-will because almost nobody is spending half their day browsing the platform you’re posting on.

## Quantity over quality helps you produce quality over quantity
I’ve been producing content since I was 12. When I first started, my videos were abysmmal but I do remember feeling completely myself and not worrying about lighting, SEO, or the best time to post the video.

I went on to produce over 250 videos and truly only the last 20-30 I’m *actually* proud of. Now, I spend almost a week working on a video or even a month collecting sources and jotting down ideas for an article like this.

**The point:** you will never produce something great until you start to produce a lot of stuff this isn’t. Digital gardens provide an environment that encourages you to continually improve for the sake of self-improvement, not followers, likes, or success.
