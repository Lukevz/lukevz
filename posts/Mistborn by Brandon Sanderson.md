Sometimes Kelsier felt that a skaa Misting’s life wasn’t so much about surviving as it was about picking the right time to die.

She could act weak, the way she had with Camon, but instincts told her that these men wouldn’t respond well to that tactic. So she remained where she was, assessing the situation.

The only reason to be subservient to those with power is so that you can learn to someday take what they have.


Breeze raised an eyebrow, then laid a hand on Yeden’s shoulder. “You should try not to talk so much, friend,” he suggested. “You’ll sound far less stupid that way.”


“The trick is to never stop looking. There’s always another secret.”


She was a quiet, small thing, but she hid an intensity that he found impressive. She was paranoid, true, but not timid.

She had always been forced to fight to find privacy. Being given it so easily seemed to devalue the years she had spent relishing her brief moments of solitude.

“the entire point of life is to find ways to get others to do your work for you. Don’t you know anything about basic economics?”


Hopefully, he would be able to encourage the skills while helping heal the scars.


“You look surprised,” Kelsier noted. “I…assumed that I’d have to earn this somehow.” “What’s there to earn?” Kelsier said, pulling out his own cloak. “This is who you are, Vin.”


He had that same glint of disappointment in his eyes, and he spoke with the same air of disapproval.


“humor is the only thing I’ve got left. Humor and determination.”

Oddly, his affable nonchalance made him very difficult to read.


It had never bothered her before when other crewleaders left her out of their planning sessions. Vin took a seat in one of the stiffly upholstered maroon chairs, tucking her feet up beneath her. She knew what the problem was. Kelsier had been showing her too much respect, making her feel too important. She was beginning to think that she deserved to be part of his secret confidences. Reen’s laughter in the back of her mind discredited those thoughts, and she sat, annoyed at both herself and Kelsier, feeling ashamed, but not exactly certain why.


The right belief is like a good cloak, I think. If it fits you well, it keeps you warm and safe. The wrong fit, however, can suffocate.”


People are valuable, Mistress Vin, and so—therefore—are their beliefs.

“She deserves more time to learn about her powers. I feel a little guilty about pulling her into our plans. She’ll probably end up at a Ministry execution ceremony with the rest of us.”


Life as a human being is about posturing and influence.


If people associate strong emotion with an event, they’ll remember it better.”


As Reen had always said, results made quick friends.


As she carefully descended—trying not to trip—she was grateful for the footman’s steadying hand, and she finally realized why men were expected to help a lady out of her carriage. It wasn’t a silly custom after all—the clothing was the silly part.


None of them could see Vin, they could only see the face she had put on—the face she wanted them to see. They saw Lady Valette. It was as if Vin weren’t there. As if … she were hiding, hiding right in front of their eyes.


She didn’t need shadows or corners—she just needed a mask of sapphires, makeup, and blue fabric.


Already, she was beginning to think too much like a noblewoman. She was admiring the beauty of the decorations—thinking about what they meant—without giving more than a passing thought to the wealth that had created them. It was just that everything here was so wondrous and ornate.


I wonder if they take any notice of the outside world, she thought, crossing her arms on the table as she watched the dancing. Perhaps they can’t see beyond their keeps and their balls—like they can’t see past my dress and makeup.

“That’s the funny thing about arriving somewhere, Vin,” he said with a wink. “Once you’re there, the only thing you can really do is leave again.

There was no use in being rich if she died.


Reen had left when he could. Perhaps he’d known that the Inquisitors would eventually hunt her down for the powers she unwittingly possessed. He always had known when to leave—it was no accident,


“The best liars are those who tell the truth most of the time.”


Vin shrugged. “How can those things be right or wrong? That’s just the way things are.” “I suppose,” Kelsier said. “But, I think your mind-set is part of the wrongness. The world shouldn’t look like this.”

“My brother said that anyone would betray you, if they had the right chance and a good enough motive.” Sazed frowned. “Even if such a thing were true, I would not want to live believing it.”

Vin shrugged. “How can those things be right or wrong? That’s simply the way things are.” “I suppose,” Kelsier said. “But I think your mind-set is part of the wrongness. The world shouldn’t look like this.”


Kelsier shrugged. “I think … I think given the choice between loving Mare—betrayal included—and never knowing her, I’d choose love. I risked, and I lost, but the risk was still worth it. It’s the same with my friends. Suspicion is healthy in our profession—but only to an extent. I’d rather trust my men than worry about what will happen if they turn on me.”

Though, it would be best not to trust his narrative too closely, Kelsier thought, running his fingers across the page. Men rarely see their own actions as unjustified.


she was concerned about the changes her new lifestyle was encouraging within her. Once, her problems had been things like starvation and beatings—now they were things like extended carriage rides and companions who arrived late for appointments. What did a transformation like that do to a person?


Perhaps that was a good attribute in a leader. He wasn’t afraid to incorporate new ideas, no matter when they occurred to him.


Most of my life, I’ve had the opposite problem, Kelsier thought with amusement, walking with Yeden off of the boat. Too much presence, not enough earnestness.

He shared Kelsier’s lanky build and blond hair, but he wasn’t as handsome. Maybe it was the lack of a smile.

I know how you feel, my friend, Kelsier thought. I’m a thief, not a prophet. Sometimes, we just have to be what the job requires.

Many Keepers have a particular area of interest—mine is religion—but we all remember the entire collection. If just one of us survives until the death of the Lord Ruler, then the world’s people will be able to recover all that they have lost.”


We will find our answers eventually, I think. Even if we do not, we will still have provided an invaluable service for mankind. Other people call us docile and servile, but we have fought him, in our own way.”


“But, what is money? A physical representation of the abstract concept of effort.


It wasn’t that she didn’t want to work, but Kelsier’s snappy wit and optimism helped keep her moving.


To fight a battle like Kelsier and Dockson were, it was probably more effective—and better for the psyche—to assume that all of their enemies were evil.

Despite what he often said, Elend Venture did not consider himself to be a rude man. He was more of a…verbal philosopher. He liked to test and turn conversation to see how people would react. Like the great thinkers of old, he pushed boundaries and experimented with unconventional methods.

It does gentlemen good to be forced to wait upon a woman’s whims—or, so my mother was always fond of telling me.”


“That is the nature of all life, Mistress,” Sazed said. “The world must change.”


I don’t want these things to change. I don’t want my life to go back to the way it was a year ago.” “It doesn’t have to, Mistress,” Sazed said. “It could change for the better.”


Everything’s going to change, Sazed, and I can’t stop it.” Sazed smiled fondly. “Then, Mistress,” he said quietly, “simply enjoy what you have. The future will surprise you, I think.”

“Anyone can believe in someone, or something, that always succeeds, Mistress. But failure…ah, now, that is hard to believe in, certainly and truly. Difficult enough to have value, I think.”


“Sometimes we just have to wait long enough, Mistress,” he said. “Then we find out why exactly it was that we kept believing.

“Belief isn’t simply a thing for fair times and bright days, I think. What is belief—what is faith—if you don’t continue in it after failure?”

She’d been through too many recent twists in her fortune, too many emotional strains—both Allomantic and non-Allomantic. She wasn’t certain what she wanted anymore; she wasn’t certain if she were Vin or Valette, or even which of them she wished she were.
