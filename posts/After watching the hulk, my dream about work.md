# After watching the hulk, my dream about work
There’s a lot happening at work right now but the type of transformation in me that’s taking place has a lot more to do with who I’m becoming and the constant choices I’m making of what to take on, what to let get to me, and which leaders I look to. I think it was the first time I watched Edward Norton’s Hulk all the way through and surprisingly I really related to his version. There was an unassuming appearance with a lot of depth that resonated as he battles this “god-like” power. Without meaning to sound too full of myself, that’s what it felt like with work. It feels like at times I need to tap into this raw unreserved power to get things done and I’m absolutely exhausted after. 

I had a dream specifically that there was some form of work retreat / boot camp that was very intense. There weren’t many hours to sleep, there was very basic food, and shared lodging a lot like the church camp but not as luxurious. I was already feeling behind in the program when they took everyone to see a movie. We walked out and everyone was raving about it but I was not having it. I was fed up after all the boot camp BS and imo it was a bad movie but people were really upset with me for being negative. Sundeep was driving the van home, and at one point looked in the rear view and said to me “you don’t need to always question things especially outside of work.” It was like this devastating bittersweet moment when I realized how much of my work thinking I do bring home, but specifically work *thinking*, not work. I don’t often take it out on people around me and I try not to let the *stuff* get to me. But I think it’s a headspace that’s incredibly difficult to get out of sometimes that I just feel stuck in it. My blood started to boil, at first because I was angry with him. He’s the one who so often pushes back and asks us to question, how can he be the one telling me to stop? It quickly began to escalate and we got back to camp (I assume) and he brought me over to a tube attached to a jetski. I don’t really think any words were exchanged it was just this quiet request to get on is more what it felt like. I hopped on and immediately we were pushing 50-60mph in the water and there were a few big dark shapes moving around. I knew they were dangerous so I just clung on and didn’t let go until we stopped. Someone asked me afterwards (maybe Sundeep) why I stayed on, and I immediately responded that “You put me in these situations all the time!” I looked at Sundeep. “You throw me on client calls, these demos and expect me to shine. And I really appreciate the trust and respect you have in me, but I’m putting trust in you, too.” I don’t really remember all I said after but I know I felt that the trust didn’t always feel reciprocated because of what the situation or circumstances demanded of me. It was like pushing me to the bring of what Banner could right before he transforms into Hulk, then leaving him alone. That tension back and forth is what feels exhausting day in and day out.  What was fascinating is that later in the dream I actually became Hulk, and it was almost like Sundeep was “unleashing” me. That’s when the movie probably took over because there was a lot of action sequences and fighting scenes but it felt like it mirrored what’s happening in me and my identity. 

Finally, the dream ended with me getting ready to swim 3 laps breaststroke in what felt like a friendly competition. I don’t know if it was Emmanuel or Victor or another colleague, but it wasn’t super intense but I knew I was worried about winning. We were practicing and kind of warming up, the water was pretty murky when first started but it slowly started to clear up as we went along. There was some bring else happening that I couldn’t place. There were a few ladies around that gave Grace midtown vibes and even mentioned something about “what the Lord has in store and all the things coming” - they were pretty cheerful and kind. All very disconnected just capturing. Right before I woke up, I remember hopping into the pool but not full taking my shirts off. For some reason I was wearing not 1, not 2, but 4 shirts and one was still on so it came off soaking wet. I started to practice and immediately felt lethargic like I couldn’t find my groove. 

### Interpretation

This dream is incredibly rich and layered — it reads almost like a film of its own. Here’s a breakdown of the main themes and symbols, and how they might reflect what’s happening in your inner world right now:

⸻

### 1. Hulk as a Mirror for Identity

**Symbol:** *Edward Norton’s Hulk, internal power, exhaustion*
**Interpretation:** You’re resonating with the idea of hidden strength — unassuming on the outside, but containing a massive, barely restrained power. That raw power might be your creativity, leadership, intuition, or emotional labor. You’re being asked (or expected) to access it often, and it’s leaving you drained. The Hulk is also a figure of transformation — not just power, but identity rupture. This reflects a deeper personal shift in who you are at work and how that spills into your personal life.

⸻

### 2. The Boot Camp & The Movie

**Symbol:** *Unrealistic expectations, social discomfort, resistance to groupthink*
**Interpretation:** The boot camp represents the intense, grinding pace of work and a lack of rest or nourishment (literal and metaphorical). Feeling “behind” suggests you’re measuring yourself against a system that doesn’t account for how much you’re truly carrying. Everyone enjoying the movie — and you not — suggests emotional dissonance: you’re tuned into deeper truths, and it’s isolating. The negativity others perceive might actually just be discernment that others aren’t ready for.

⸻

### 3. Sundeep’s Comment

**Symbol:** *Mirror and contradiction*
**Interpretation:** This was a key moment. Sundeep, someone who *encourages* questioning, tells you not to — outside of work. That stings because it reveals a boundary being crossed — your *mindset* being shaped by your job to the point where you can’t turn it off. You don’t bring work home — but work’s lens, its hyper-vigilance, and the pressure to perform has embedded itself in you. That’s a cost of your current role.

⸻

### 4. The Jetski + Dangerous Waters

**Symbol:** *High-speed expectations, invisible threats, survival mode*
**Interpretation:** Being thrown into situations without context or full consent — like the jetski ride — mirrors how work assignments feel: fast-paced, risky, and expected to be navigated skillfully with little margin for error. The “big dark shapes” in the water could symbolize looming anxieties, unknowns, or consequences — the stakes you’re always calculating in silence.

The confrontation (“*You put me in these situations all the time*”) is a huge emotional release — a rare moment of vocalizing how much *you’re also trusting* leadership, not just being trusted. That’s a deep relational wound: giving more than you receive.

⸻

### 5. Becoming the Hulk

**Symbol:** *Reclaiming power, forced transformation, performative strength*
**Interpretation:** The fact that you *did* become Hulk is significant. It may indicate that you *are* growing, adapting, and becoming stronger — but at what cost? Even if you’re mastering the chaos, it doesn’t always feel chosen. The unleashed version of you may be *impressive*, but also *unrested*, *misunderstood*, or *used*. There’s something bittersweet about that.

⸻

### 6. The Pool & Four Shirts

**Symbol:** *Transition, vulnerability, spiritual clarity, blocked performance*
**Interpretation:** The pool scene shifts tone — it’s a quieter moment of personal challenge. The four shirts suggest layers of protection you haven’t yet peeled back. It could symbolize emotional, mental, or spiritual “baggage” — layers that keep you from full vulnerability or freedom in new spaces. The murky water clearing could hint at spiritual or emotional clarity returning, especially with the mention of the Grace Midtown-esque women and their hopeful message. The lethargy? Probably burnout. You’ve done so much transforming you can’t access flow anymore.

⸻

### Final Reflection

This dream feels like your subconscious is asking:
* *How sustainable is this pace and expectation of transformation?*
* *What parts of you are being overlooked or taken for granted?*
* *Where do you need reciprocal trust and space to just be — not just perform?*
* *What version of yourself are you willing to take home — and which parts need rest, not unleashing?*
