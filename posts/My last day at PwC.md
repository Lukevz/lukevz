# My last day at PwC
#status/complete

Today marks my last day at PwC as the global design system manager and a senior product designer. Over the near 4 years I worked here, I’ve been honored to meet thousands of incredible people all over the world and push the edge of innovation time and again. To all my dedicated coworkers, trusted mentors, and the vendors I’ve had the privilege of collaborating with, thank you. While there is far too much to say in one post, I will leave you all with 7 of the most valuable lessons I have learned here:

1. Nothing meaningful can be built without trust. Protect it at all costs.
2. Challenge assumptions constantly - Define the actual problem at hand. 
3. Keep it simple - Ask: Does this need to get done? Do we need to be the ones to do it? Do we need to do it now?
4. Stay focused, filter the noise - urgency often masks ambiguity.
5. Build with care even in the small things.
6. Communication is the bottleneck for all creative work. Be clear and concise.
7. You don’t have to get it right on the first try. Innovation is sometimes relentless experimentation.

More to come.
