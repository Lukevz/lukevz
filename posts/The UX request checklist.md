# The UX request checklist
### **🧭 Before You Start**
- [ ] Is the request clearly defined?
- [ ] Have we validated *why* this needs to be done?
- [ ] Do I know where this request is coming from?
- [ ] Do I have enough context to define the problem well?
- [ ] Am I missing any key info, links, or resources?
- [ ] Have I aligned expectations on timeline and scope?
- [ ] What system-level impacts should I be aware of?
- [ ] What happens if we do nothing?
- [ ] What does “done” look like?
- [ ] What rabbit holes should I avoid?

**📦 If This Is a Project**
- [ ] Who are the stakeholders and how do they work?
- [ ] What’s the timeline and key milestones?
- [ ] Where is there flexibility, and what’s fixed?
- [ ] What are the true priorities?
- [ ] What does success look like—for users and the team?
- [ ] Where is the ambiguity, and who resolves it?
- [ ] Are we solving the root cause or just a symptom?
- [ ] Can we test this with a smaller, faster experiment?
