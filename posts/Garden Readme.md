# Garden Readme
#writing

This is a simulated environment of my actual notetaking app, [Bear](https://bear.app/). Here you can browse my actual notes in progress (at least the ones I chose to share) exactly the way that I craft them.

My tagging system has changed a lot of the years. Part of the reason I settled on this app was how tag-focused it was, making it easy to quickly jot ideas down and still maintain structure. As of Nov 23, 2025, here's how I sort things.

```
business
├── career
├── house
├── ideas
├── instinct
└── uxwithluke

commonplace
├── books
├── games
├── movies
├── music
├── quotes
└── vocab

├── claire
├── family
├── health
├── journal
├── northstar

└── travel

This note – and other Digital Garden artifacts – is stored in "# writing."
