# Behavior Rebuilds What Talk Can’t
You can’t talk your way out of a problem you behaved your way into—but you can behave your way out of a problem you talked yourself into. That’s the heart of **relationship trust**. Deposits and withdrawals aren’t theoretical—they’re shaped by the 13 micro-behaviors: talking straight, listening first, keeping commitments, etc. Trust isn’t built in theory; it’s built transactionally.
