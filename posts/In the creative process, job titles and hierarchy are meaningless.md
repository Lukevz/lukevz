# In the creative process, job titles and hierarchy are meaningless

In truly innovative environments, creativity isn’t dictated by titles. Pixar’s culture recognizes that a great idea can come from *anyone*—intern or executive. Hierarchies may serve logistical roles, but they can’t determine who sees the problem most clearly or imagines the best path forward. Flattening the lines of communication helps ideas rise on merit, not status.
