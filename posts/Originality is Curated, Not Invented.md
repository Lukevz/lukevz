# Originality is Curated, Not Invented


All creative work is a remix. What we call originality is often just well-curated influence—intentionally surrounding yourself with inspiring sources and tracing what resonates. Copying, when done deliberately, is a form of reverse engineering. It teaches structure, rhythm, and form, eventually guiding you toward your own voice. As Yoji Yamamoto put it: “Copy copy copy… at the end of the copy, you will find yourself.”
