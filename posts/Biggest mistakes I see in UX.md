# Biggest mistakes I see in UX
1. Using the wrong method to communicate to users (modal vs minimal notification)
2. Fonts not consistent and font sizes too big for too small
3. Overwhelming color
4. Not making things inclusive
5. Adding too much or too little spacing
6. Using too many labels not icons for actions, actions need hiererchy
7. Overwhelming users with information (statuses, everything above fold or not in accordions)
8. Lack of continuity (page title one size in dashboard, different in the project detail)
9. Touch targets for mobile
