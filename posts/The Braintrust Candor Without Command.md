# The Braintrust: Candor Without Command
The Braintrust is Pixar’s radical mechanism for honest feedback without power dynamics. It thrives on mutual trust, emotional safety, and the understanding that no one owns the idea. Feedback is offered—not mandated—and is meant to be perspective-shifting, not directive. It works because it decouples criticism from ego and hierarchy.
