title: "Mushroom Networks to Internet Infrastructure"
startPoint: "Reddit post about mycelium networks"
endPoint: "How undersea fiber optic cables are laid"
route:
  - Mycelial networks connect trees underground
  - Chemical signaling between plants
  - Packet switching in computer networks
  - Neural networks and biological inspiration
  - Internet backbone infrastructure
  - Undersea cable mapping projects
takeaways: "Natural systems have been doing distributed networking for millions of years before we invented the internet."
quote: "The internet is just spicy mycelium"
whyCared: "Wondered if mushroom networks could inspire better network protocols."
