title: "From Black Holes to Skydiving Physics"
startPoint: "Twitter thread about Interstellar's event horizon scene"
endPoint: "Wikipedia page comparing terminal velocities"
route:
  - Event horizons and Schwarzschild radius
  - Time dilation near massive objects
  - Gravitational acceleration vs air resistance
  - Terminal velocity formula (Vt = √(2mg/ρACd))
  - Human body terminal velocity (~120 mph)
  - Felix Baumgartner's record jump
takeaways: "Gravity works the same whether cosmic or terrestrial - it's all about mass, distance, and resistance."
quote: "A black hole is where God divided by zero - Steven Wright"
whyCared: "Started wondering if falling into a black hole would feel different than skydiving."
